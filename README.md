# MyTelegramAssistentAI

I decided to develop my own assistant (if possible). The main component (or AI) is ChatGPT, and the subsequent will be auxiliary AI and some services of the API client.

For example:
I can periodically upload information about the weather in AI, and at one time ask it.
Ask to improve photos or generate.
Etc.

The main task is to choose the correct architecture of regulation, because some services will be launched only during the request, others during the period of their relevance or constantly.
