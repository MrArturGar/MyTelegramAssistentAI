# MyTelegramAssistentAI

I decided to develop my own assistant (if possible). The main component (or AI) is ChatGPT, and the subsequent will be auxiliary AI and some services of the API client. I can choose a name for the AI myself and give it up-to-date information for today.

For example:
I can periodically upload information about the weather in AI, and at one time ask it.
Ask to improve photos or generate.
Etc.
